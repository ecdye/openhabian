systems. As of openHAB 4.3 a log-viewer is built in to openHAB, and frontail
has serious security vulnerabilities present and is no longer maintained. We
apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

We have removed legacy support for the openHAB 2 systems. Please upgrade to
the latest version of openHAB to receive further support.
